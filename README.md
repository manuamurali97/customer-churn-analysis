Customer Churn Analysis using ML models
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models, based on historical customer behavior data.
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation.
The goal is to help businesses identify customers likely to leave, so they can take proactive retention measures.

Features

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualizations to understand churn patterns.

Feature Engineering – Create meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.

Multiple ML Models – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, AdaBoost.

Model Evaluation – Compare models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Feature Importance Analysis – Identify key factors influencing churn.

Results
Best Model: Random Forest (Accuracy: 85%, ROC-AUC: 0.91)

Key Churn Drivers: Tenure, Contract Type, Monthly Charges

Business Insight: Customers with month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges are most likely to churn.
